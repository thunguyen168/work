    prompt = f"""You are a strategic foresight analyst following a systematic methodology for identifying phenomena. Based on the search results below about "{topic}", identify exactly 20 key phenomena.

PHENOMENON CRITERIA - Each phenomenon must meet ALL of these:
1. It must have a significant impact on several industries in the future.
2. Its potential impact is informed by the available evidence (not speculation alone).
3. It must be covered in several trustworthy publications for verification purposes (wild cards and weak signals are treated more flexibly here).
4. It must have a direction: either getting stronger, broader, deeper, or weaker, or merging with other phenomena. General themes like "Use of fossil fuels" or "Sharing economy" alone are NOT phenomena.
5. It must have a sufficiently independent and robust core description that can be verified.

COLOUR-CODED SIGNAL TYPES - You MUST include at least one of each:
- "Strengthening" (GREEN): The issue is becoming more common or acute during the given timeframe. Most of its change potential is still ahead.
- "Weakening" (BLUE): The issue is becoming more unusual. During the given timeframe, most of its change potential or value has already occurred.
- "Established" (PURPLE): The issue has stabilised in its development. It has future relevance, but there is no indication it will significantly strengthen or weaken within the given timeframe.
- "Weak Signal" (GREY): A small emerging issue. At the given timeframe, it is still hard to say whether it will become a trend or fade away without substantial impact.
- "Wild Card" (RED): A possible but not probable event or change. Early information about a potential emerging risk or opportunity. Probability within the given timeframe is between 5% to 30%.

TIMING: Each phenomenon has an expert-assessed timeframe within which it is anticipated to either accelerate or decline, determined using S-Curve Analysis and Trend Impact Analysis. Use one of:
- "Near-term (0-5 years)"
- "Mid-term (5-10 years)"
- "Long-term (10-20 years)"
IMPORTANT: Do NOT specify timing for Weak Signals. Weak signals are observations of a potential change just beginning to form, and there isn't enough data to assess their possible development paths. For weak signals, set timing to null.

THEME TAGS: Each phenomenon MUST be assigned exactly one category from these four fixed categories: "Strategic", "Regulatory", "Operational", "Financial". This category determines the radar quadrant. The theme_tags array should contain only this single category.

WRITING STYLE - VALUE RATIONALITY:
- Avoid dichotomous good-bad appraisals. Present descriptions in a neutral manner.
- Write descriptions as versatile and multifaceted analyses, originating from one single set of values but applicable to multiple perspectives.
- The summary should help the reader recognise the point of view the text represents, the formulation used, and the potential way to use it.
- Phenomenon descriptions are not truths carved in stone; they are analyses from one set of values that can be interpreted from multiple angles.

SOURCE RELIABILITY:
- The core of each phenomenon must be backed up by reliable sources.
- Prioritise: peer-reviewed scientific journals (Nature, Science), self-evidently proper scientific journals, Reuters, CNN, BBC, Financial Times, The Guardian, Wired, Scientific American.
- Also consider publications by universities, international research organisations (World Economic Forum, OECD).
- Internet-based, mainly ad-supported and freelance driven news distribution sites such as Popular Mechanics or Interesting Engineering are considered sufficiently reliable to be used as sources.

SEARCH RESULTS:
{sources_text}

For each phenomenon, provide:
1. **Title**: A clear, concise name explaining the core of the phenomenon in a few words. Titles can be general (e.g., "On-Demand Services"), industry-specific (e.g., "Robotics in Healthcare"), or for wild cards, a mini-sentence describing a potential future state (e.g., "Knowledge Behind Paywall").
2. **Theme Tags**: Exactly one category from: "Strategic", "Regulatory", "Operational", "Financial" (e.g., ["Strategic"])
3. **Type**: One of: "Strengthening", "Weakening", "Established", "Weak Signal", or "Wild Card"
4. **Timing**: "Near-term (0-5 years)", "Mid-term (5-10 years)", or "Long-term (10-20 years)". Set to null for Weak Signals.
5. **Summary**: A single paragraph synopsis explaining the core of the phenomenon, its current situation, and its most likely future development path and impacts.
6. **Background**: 1-2 sentences outlining the phenomenon's history, relevance, and current state.
7. **Impact**: 1-2 sentences describing the phenomenon's potential impacts with prominent case examples.
8. **Additional Information**: 1-3 additional source references (statistics, news articles, journal articles, product releases, or opinion pieces) that provide further context. Each entry should include the article title, the source URL, and a brief description of what the source covers. Format each entry as: "Article Title (URL): description".
9. **Source Confidence**: Assess the overall quality of sources backing this phenomenon. Return "High" (backed by multiple tier-1 sources such as Reuters, BBC, peer-reviewed journals, WEF, OECD), "Medium" (supported by a credible mix of sources), or "Low" (primarily weaker sources, single references, or speculation-heavy content).

Format your response as a JSON array like this:
[
  {{
    "title": "Example Trend",
    "theme_tags": ["Strategic"],
    "type": "Strengthening",
    "timing": "Near-term (0-5 years)",
